## Epi Labor Force Data Raw

**Varible Code**
Each variable is followed by a number indicating the year.

- Npop: Population
- Nfl: Number in fabor force*
- Nemp: Number employed
- Nunemp: Number unemployed
- Nlong: Number long-term unemployed**
- Npt: Number part-time*** - this doesn't appear until 94'
- Nptec: IDK (a little help please) - this doesn't appear until 94'
- Ndisc: IDK (a little help please) - this doesn't appear until 94'

* When calculating percents use this number (e.g. %unemplyed = Nfl/Nemp)
** The long-term unemployment rate is the share of workers who have been jobless for 27 weeks or more [(source)[https://www.epi.org/publication/long-term-unemployment-scarring/]].
*** Unsure if this is by choice. I think it is lumping together people that want part-time work with those that do not.
