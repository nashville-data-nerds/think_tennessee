A place to coordinate and collaborate around analytic work with [Think Tennessee](https://thinktennessee.org/)

# Steps to getting started

1. Fill out this form if you have not already as it will inform me about your interest and experience [Non-profit Data Volunteering](https://forms.gle/bHpH2MbZNsPEK64K7)
2. Sign the [NDA](https://github.com/nashville-data-nerds/think_tennessee/blob/master/documents/ThinkTN%20Form%20Non-Disclosure%20Agreement_Data%20Nerds.pdf) and e-mail to nashville.data.nerds@gmail.com
3. Contact nashville.data.nerds@gmail.com with the following information:
  - Your GitHub account to be added to the organization
  - Your desired AWS account in order to be added to the Nashville Data Nerds AWS account which is where all data will be shared via S3.
  
# Reason for NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)

To provide context around the NDA, the data we will be working with is from the https://www.epi.org/ and is not publicly available and is shared with Think Tennessee for the explicit purpose of policy research.  
If you are not familiar with NDA's, I highly recommend you always fully read an NDA before signing.  Since the the data we are receiving is not publicly available, we need to be careful and respectful of Think Tennessee allowing us to use it.

If you have any questions about what is okay or not okay, please reach out to me, adantonison@gmail.com or @adantonison on slack, and I would be happy to talk further.

## Things _to do_ with the https://www.epi.org/ data
- You can of course download the data, explore it, and gain a better understanding of it.  But all end results should be targeted towards the work we are doing for Think Tennessee. :slightly_smiling_face: 

## Things _not to do_ with the https://www.epi.org/ data
- Please do not upload to websites like GitHub or data platforms like https://data.world/.
- Please do not use for personal projects, even if those projects are not-for-profit.

# Project Workflow

## Overall Strategy

To reduce the amount of tools or websites people will need to access, we will be be managing all code and deliverables within GitHub. 

## Task Management

Tasks will be managed via GitHub issues.  When creating an issue, please provide as much deatil as possible and apply appropriate labels.

## Deliverable Feedback

Feedback for deliverables will be done through GitHub Pull requests.  This will allow for us to iterate within GitHub and track those changes all within a pull request which can be tied to an issue in GitHub that will provide the scope of the task.

## Source Control Strategy

We will be using a trunk based source control strategy.  To summarize, you should create branches off of master for each issue you work on and you should make note the issue you are working in the Pull Request.  I encourage people to open a pull request as they are working on the issue to help with getting timely feedback. See [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) if you are interested in more details around the Trunk Based source control strategy.

## Technology

We will be using Python 3.7.  We will be using Anaconda to help manage both python version as well as package management.  Please see the following websites to get familiar with using Anaconda and managing environemnts within Anaconda.
- [Installing Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
- [Anaconda Getting Started](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)
